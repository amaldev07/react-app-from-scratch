Creating a React application involves several steps, and you can set up a React project using various tools and methods. In this guide, I'll walk you through one common way to create a React application using Create React App (CRA), a popular tool for bootstrapping React projects quickly.

Here are the steps to create a React application using Create React App:

Install Node.js and npm:  

Install Create React App (CRA): Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
npm install -g create-react-app

Create a New React App: Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React application by running the following command in your terminal:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

Replace my-react-app with the desired name for your project. This command will set up a new React project with all the necessary files and dependencies.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current working directory to the newly created project folder:
cd my-react-app

Run the Development Server: You can start the development server and see your React application in action by running the following command:
npm start

This will start a development server, and your React app will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can access it in your web browser.

Edit Your React App: The project structure generated by CRA will have a src folder where you can find the main React components. You can start editing these components and create new ones to build your application.

Building and Deploying: When you're ready to build your React app for production, you can run:
npm run build
This command will create an optimized production build of your application in the build folder. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.

That's it! You now have a basic React application up and running. You can continue to develop your app by adding components, styles, and functionality as needed.

Remember that there are other ways to create React applications, such as manually setting up your development environment or using other tools like TypeScript or Next.js. The choice depends on your specific requirements and preferences.

? I need to create 2 routes, one for a landing page where I show a list of companies and the second for company details page

To create a React application with two routes—one for a landing page displaying a list of companies and another for a company details page—you'll need to use a routing library. One of the most commonly used routing libraries for React is react-router-dom. Here's how you can set up these routes in your React application:

Install react-router-dom:

In your project directory, install react-router-dom as a dependency:
npm install react-router-dom

Create Route Components:
Create two components, one for the landing page (list of companies) and another for the company details page. You can name them LandingPage.js and CompanyDetails.js, for example.

LandingPage.js (Example for the landing page):
```import React from 'react';

const LandingPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>List of Companies</h2>
      {/* Display your list of companies here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LandingPage;
```
CompanyDetails.js (Example for the company details page):
```
import React from 'react';

const CompanyDetails = ({ match }) => {
  const { companyId } = match.params; // Access the company ID from the URL params

  // Fetch and display company details based on the companyId

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Company Details</h2>
      {/* Display company details here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CompanyDetails;
```

Set Up Routing:
In your src directory, create a new file named App.js (if it doesn't exist) or modify your existing App.js file to set up routing.

```
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import LandingPage from './LandingPage';
import CompanyDetails from './CompanyDetails';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
        <Route path="/company/:companyId" component={CompanyDetails} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```
In this code:

We import BrowserRouter as Router and Route components from react-router-dom.
We define two routes:
The first route (exact path="/") renders the LandingPage component when the root URL is accessed.
The second route (path="/company/:companyId") renders the CompanyDetails component when a URL matching this pattern is accessed. It expects a dynamic companyId parameter in the URL, which can be accessed via match.params.
Link to Company Details:

To navigate to the company details page, you can create links in your LandingPage component like this:
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
// Inside the render method of LandingPage
<ul>
  <li>
    <Link to="/company/1">Company 1</Link>
  </li>
  <li>
    <Link to="/company/2">Company 2</Link>
  </li>
  {/* Add more links for other companies */}
</ul>
Replace the example links with your actual company data.

Start the Development Server:

Run your development server with npm start and test your routes by accessing the landing page and company details page URLs in your browser.

That's it! You've set up two routes in your React application—one for the landing page listing companies and another for displaying company details. You can further customize and expand your application based on your specific requirements.
